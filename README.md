# Mall Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This project demonstrates the application of K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, for customer segmentation in a mall dataset. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behavior and demographic features, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved customer insights.

## Key Features
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for clustering.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between features to gain insights into customer behavior.
* K-Means Algorithm: Implementing and optimizing K-Means for clustering customers.
* Visualization: Displaying the results using scatter plots and cluster visualizations.
## Tools and Technologies
* Python: Programming language for implementation.
* Scikit-learn: For clustering and data analysis.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
* Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/mall-customers-segmentation
The project uses a dataset containing customer information such as gender, age, annual income, and spending score. This dataset is widely used for customer segmentation tasks.

## Results
The analysis results in meaningful clusters that provide insights into customer segments, such as high spenders, budget-conscious buyers, and mid-tier customers.
